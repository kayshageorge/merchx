MerchX - Api

MerchX is a platform to aid small bands in streamlining their merch sales at small venues. By allowing customers to pay for items through a web application with their saved card details, bands are able to cash in on opportunity sales they may not have gotten with a cash only merch stand.

# Setup

```
Run the following commands in the project directory:

$ bundle
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails db:seed
$ rails s

Open on http://localhost:3000
```
